README for py-roms2roms

Version 1.0.1

py-roms2roms is a Python version of roms2roms (see Mason etal, 2010 and
www.molemaker.org) that was written in Matlab.

pyroms2roms creates ROMS boundary files for offline nesting, but it has
expanded to make:

(1) boundary files with SODA, Mercator, ECCO2, IBI
(2) forcing files using CFSR and/or CCMP.
